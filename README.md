 #Electronics Learning Journey
Welcome to my personal repository where I document my exploration into electronics. This space serves as a log of my experiments, projects, and the knowledge I acquire along the way.

 # Repository Contents
Component Studies: Notes and experiments with basic components like resistors, capacitors, LEDs, and transistors.

## Circuit Projects: Simple circuits I've built, such as blinking LEDs and basic amplifiers.

## Simulation Files: Circuit simulations using tools like LTspice and Tinkercad.

## Project Logs: Detailed records of my hands-on projects, including schematics and outcomes.

ðŸš€ Getting Started
Feel free to explore the folders and files to see my progress. Each project includes schematics, component lists, and notes on what I've learned.
